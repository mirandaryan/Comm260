    <h1>Travel to .... <strong class="berlin">Berlin</strong></h1>

    <p>Located in the north east of the country, Berlin sits on the banks of the river Spree. Geographically the city lies on the European plain, a flat and fertile area of land that extends all the way to Russia.</p>

    <p>Perhaps surprisingly for a populous urban area of around 3.7 million people, Berlin is a very green city with over a third of the metropolitan area comprising of gorgeous parks, gardens and forests.</p>
