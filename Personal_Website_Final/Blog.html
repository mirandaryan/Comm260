                    Setting up a home blacksmith shop is not that difficult. You can get everything you need for about $300-500 if you buy used equipment and make what you can yourself.

                    The main tools you’ll need to get started are a forge, an anvil, a vise, a hammer and tongs. One of the great things about blacksmithing is that you can make many of the tools yourself, as you go.

                    The forge is what you’ll use to heat the metal that you’re working. It consists of a firepot to hold the fire, a work surface and a blower. The firepot should be about 4-5 inches deep and can be made from an old brake drum. The forge I use is made of brick and firebrick and is more substantial, but I’ve also seen forges on old farms made from concrete poured into a tractor tire, with a depression for the firepot. You can find blowers in antique stores or salvage them from air conditioning units, clothes dryers or other used appliances. My dad’s first forge was basically a brake drum with legs. The blower was an old hair dryer!

                    Unless you have a lot of money to spend, it’s best to start with a used anvil. You can find them for about $1-2 per pound. Even if an anvil has some dings, it can be cleaned up and resurfaced if necessary, and it will work just fine.  A “wanted” ad in the paper is a good way to find these and other blacksmithing equipment. We’ve also found anvils and other blacksmithing equipment at farm sales, estate sales and farm auctions.

                <h3 class="blog-heading">How to Make Tongs</h3>
                <h5>November 22nd, 2021</h5>
                <p>
                    It’s essential to have good sets of tongs for blacksmithing so that you can firmly the hold hot metal that you’re working with.  You’ll need different sizes and styles to match the thickness and shapes of the metal that you’re using in your projects. A blacksmith can’t have too many pairs of tongs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have recently developed a tong-making class for blacksmithing students who’ve taken our Blacksmithing I and II classes. This tutorial shows one approach to making a simple set of tongs. If you have some blacksmithing experience and haven’t yet made tongs, you may want to try this on your own. If you think you might need more help and oversight, then you may want to register for our class, which will teach several methods of tong-making.
