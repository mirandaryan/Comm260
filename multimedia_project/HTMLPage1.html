            <h3>About Recipe</h3>
            <p>
                The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork to whisk the eggs and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. The sugar amount is flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, including me, do just fine with 3/4 of a cup, and many are happy with a 1/2 cup.
                You can toss in a cup of chopped nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips if you want, or put the batter into muffin tins and make banana nut muffins instead. You can even go a step further and make chocolate banana bread.

            <h3>The best type of banana to use for banana bread</h3>
            <p>
                Ripe bananas make the best banana bread. And basically, the riper the better. The blacker the banana is, the sweeter it is — ensuring your bread has the most pronounced “banana-y” flavor. Just make sure the fruit hasn’t actually gone rotten.
                This makes banana bread the perfect use for those overripe bananas that have been sitting on your counter way too long. Or, even better, buy super ripe bananas from the start (bonus: they’re usually on sale).

            <h3>How to bake the perfect banana bread</h3>
            <p>
                Follow these tips to ensure perfectly baked banana bread:
                <ul>
                    <li>Grease and flour the baking pan very well.</li>
                    <li>Do not open the oven during baking unless you have to.</li>
                    <li>If your banana bread is browning too much or too quickly, lightly tent the top with foil while baking.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you preheat your oven completely to the correct temperature.</li>
                    <li>Use a toothpick to test done-ness (it’ll come out clean with a poke).</li>
                </ul>

    <h3>Banana Bread</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth.

    <p>
        3. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.
    </p>

    <p>
        4. Mix in the baking soda and salt.
    </p>

    <p>
        5. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract.
    </p>

    <p>
        6. Mix in the flour.
    </p>

    <p>
        7. Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350°F (175°C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.
    </p>

    <p>
        8. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)
